1. What is the problem you want to solve?
> I own a rental property in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with four rental apartments. The problem I’m seeking to solve is the question of what the market rate for renting an apartment similar to each of those is.
2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?
> My client is myself. The information I obtain will determine what I advertise and charge for each apartment when their leases are up for renewal.
3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
> The information I plan to use for this analysis is the rental apartment advertisements for the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Craigslist.
4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
> My evaluation plan is to use neighborhood, number of bedrooms, and price to create a data set though which, by knowing the neighborhood and number of bedrooms my property’s apartments have, I can calculate the price at which I should charge for them.
5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
> I plan to delivery all my code and source data, as well as the resulting calculation of what rate I should charge for each of my four apartmentments. I plan to present these findings in a paper and slide deck.
